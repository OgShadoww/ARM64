# ARM64 Assembly Learning Journey

This repository documents my path of mastering AArch64 (ARM64) assembly.
I focus on writing pure assembly first, then integrating it with C to build a minimal libc.

## Structure
- `/docs` → theory and notes.
- `/code` → independent programs.
- `/assets` → images and other assets.      

## Environment
- macOS M-series
- clang / ld.lld
- Assembler syntax: GNU (AT&T disabled)

## Goals
1. Write pure-asm programs and syscall wrappers.
2. Implement functions callable from C.
